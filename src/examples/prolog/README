Each .pl file in this folder contains the Prolog source text
of a simple demonstration of JPL in action calling Java from
Prolog.

Each file contains one or more predicate definitions, then
a directive to run the demo.

Consulting a file, either by double-clicking it from Windows
Explorer (if you have a default SWI-Prolog installation) or
by e.g.

   ?- [jpl_versions_demo].

from the Prolog top-level prompt, will consult and then run
the demo.
