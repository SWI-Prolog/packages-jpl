/**
 * Rational is a specialised Term representing a Prolog rational value.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Rational r1 = new Rational(2,3);
 * Rational r2 = new Rational(2r3);
 * </pre>
 *
 * A rational will be stored in its canonical form with gcd(numerator, denominator =  1 (not reducible) and
 * denominator greater than 1. If the denominator reduces to 1, a JPLException is thrown.
 *
 * Once constructed, the value of an Rational instance cannot be altered. An Rational can be used (and re-used) as an
 * argument of Compounds.
