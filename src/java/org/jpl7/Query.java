/**
 * A Query instance is created by an application in order to query the Prolog
 * database (or to invoke a built-in predicate). It is initialised with a
 * Compound (or Atom) denoting the goal which is to be called, and also contains
 * assorted private state relating to solutions. In some future version, it may
 * contain details of the module in which the goal is to be called.
 * <p>
 * A Query is either open or closed: when closed, it has no connection to the
 * Prolog system; when open, it is linked to an active goal within a Prolog
 * engine.
 * <p>
 * The Query class implements the Enumeration interface, through which one can
 * obtain successive solutions. The Enumeration hasMoreElements() method returns
 * true if the call or redo succeeded (otherwise false), and if the call or redo
 * did succeed, the nextElement() method returns a Map representing variable
 * bindings; the elements in the Map are Terms, indexed by the (String) names of
 * the Variables with which they are associated. For example, if <i>p(a)</i> and
 * <i>p(b)</i> are facts in the Prolog database, then the following is
 * equivalent to printing all the solutions to the Prolog query <i>p(X)</i>:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Variable X = new Variable(&quot;X&quot;);
 * Term arg[] = { X };
 * Query q = new Query(&quot;p&quot;, arg);
 *
 * while (q.hasMoreElements()) {
 *	Term bound_to_x = ((Map) q.nextElement()).get(&quot;X&quot;);
 *	System.out.println(bound_to_x);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Make sure to close the Query (using the close() method) if you do not need
 * any further solutions which it may have. It is safe (although redundant) to
 * close a Query whose solutions are already exhausted, or which is already
 * closed.
 *
 * To obtain just one solution from a Query, use the oneSolution() method.
 *
 * To obtain all solutions, use the allSolutions() method.
 *
 * To obtain at most N solutions, use the nSolutions() method.
 *
 * To determine merely whether the Query is provable, use the hasSolution()
 * method (i.e. has at least one solution).
