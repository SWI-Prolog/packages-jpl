/**
 * This class supports Java representations of Prolog variables.
 * <p>
 *
 * A jpl.Variable instance is equivalent to a variable in a fragment of Prolog
 * source text: it is *not* a "live" variable within a Prolog stack or heap. A
 * corresponding Prolog variable is created only upon opening a Query whose goal
 * refers to a Variable (and then only temporarily).
