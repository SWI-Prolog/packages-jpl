# Developing JPL

If you want to develop JPL further you will need to:

1. Understand the different components of JPL. There is Java, C and Prolog code involved in JPL.
2. Set-up the source tree of JPL package within the main [SWIPL source tree](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel).
    * The whole main SWIPL source trees is required to compile the whole framework using CMAKE and thus generate the C libraries.
3. Develop within the JPL package source tree, and eventually contribute to the official [packges-jpl](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/packages-jpl) repo.
4. Testing your development.
