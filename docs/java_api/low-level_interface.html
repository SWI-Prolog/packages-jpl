<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<i>[Note: if you just want to build hybrid Java+Prolog applications, you
probably don't need to know about this interface: see the <a href="high-level_interface.html">High-Level
interface</a> documentation]</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The <b><i>JPL</i></b> Low-Level interface is implemented by the Java
package <b>jpl.fli</b>.&nbsp; This package contains a set of classes that
mirror the data types in the SWI-Prolog <i>Foreign Language Interface</i>
(FLI), together with a class <b>jpl.fli.Prolog</b>, which contains static
variables and static native methods which reflect the constants and functions
in the FLI.&nbsp; The package is designed to serve as a direct translation
of the Prolog FLI and is generally not intended for the average user.&nbsp;
Its main purpose is to support the High-Level interface (q.v.), use of
which is preferable in most applications.
<p>This section provides a detailed description of the Low-Level interface
for the programmer who may wish to use it much as he or she would the FLI.&nbsp;
As such, it presumes familiarity with the Prolog FLI.&nbsp; <i>This document
is not a tutorial on how to use the Prolog FLI; </i>consult your local
Prolog documentation for how to use the FLI.&nbsp; Programmers who wish
to use <b><i>JPL</i></b> without having to know any of the nitty gritty
details of the Low-Level interface may skip this section and read the <a href="high-level_interface.html">High-Level</a>
interface section.&nbsp; For information about the SWI-Prolog FLI, see
your local SWI-Prolog documentation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The <b><i>JPL</i></b> Low-Level interface is highly SWI-Prolog specific,
unlike the High-Level interface (which could potentially be implemented
on top of at least some other Prolog systems).
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Supported Data Types"></a>Supported Data Types</h3>
The Low-Level interface provides definitions for the following support
classes, which are essentially "holder" classes for the corresponding data
types in the FLI:
<ul>
<pre>LongHolder
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; +--- term_t
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; +--&nbsp; atom_t
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; +--&nbsp; functor_t
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; +--&nbsp; qid_t
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; +--&nbsp; fid_t

PointerHolder
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; +--&nbsp; predicate_t
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; +--&nbsp; module_t</pre>
</ul>
With the exception of <b>predicate_t</b> and <b>module_t</b>, these classes
hold Java long (signed 64-bit) values, corresponding to the C types in
the FLI by the same name (unsigned long values).&nbsp; The <b>module_t</b>
and <b>predicate_t</b> classes also hold long values, but their values
are understood to be C pointers (void *).
<blockquote><i><font size=-1><b>Note.&nbsp;</b> The fact that we are using
signed values to represent unsigned values should not be a problem, since
we are not using these values in arithmetic expressions that could cause
errors as a result of casts.&nbsp; However, any SWI-Prolog implementation
that has a word size larger than 4 bytes is not guaranteed to work correctly
with this version of the Low-Level interface.</font></i></blockquote>
The Low-Level interface also provides the following convenience classes
used to get information back to the JavaVM from Prolog:
<ul>
<li>
<b>IntHolder</b></li>

<li>
<b>LongHolder</b></li>

<li>
<b>DoubleHolder</b></li>

<li>
<b>StringHolder</b></li>

<li>
<b>PointerHolder</b></li>
</ul>
These classes are for use where a SWI-Prolog FLI function takes modifiable
(by reference) parameters.
<h3>
<a NAME="jpl.fli.Prolog"></a>jpl.fli.Prolog</h3>
The class <b>jpl.fli.Prolog</b> contains a set of Java constant (static
final) and static native method declarations.&nbsp; These declarations
more or less mirror those in the header files for the FLI (in SWI-Prolog,
<i>SWI-Prolog.h</i>), and can all be found in the C source file <i>jpl_fli_Prolog.c</i>.
<p>The general rule of thumb is as follows:
<ul>
<li>
All constant and function names (with a few notable exceptions) are the
same as those in the FLI, with the Prolog implementation-specific prefix
(in the case of SWI-Prolog, <font face="Courier New,Courier">PL_</font>)
removed.&nbsp; For example, the constant <font face="Courier New,Courier">PL_VARIABLE</font>
in the FLI becomes just <font face="Courier New,Courier">VARIABLE</font>,
and the FLI function <font face="Courier New,Courier">PL_new_term_ref()</font>
becomes just <font face="Courier New,Courier">new_term_ref()</font>.&nbsp;
A notable exception is the <font face="Courier New,Courier">throw</font>
FLI function, which is renamed to <b>_throw</b> in the FLI;&nbsp; <i>throw</i>
is a reserved word in Java.</li>

<li>
All the constant values are the same in the Low-Level interface as they
are in the FLI.</li>

<li>
The signatures of FLI functions (with a few notable exceptions) are preserved
in the Low-Level interface.&nbsp; The Low-Level interface provides the
above types for this purpose.</li>

<li>
Read parameters of the primitive Java types (e.g., <b>int</b>, <b>float</b>,
<b>long</b>,
etc.) are preserved.</li>

<li>
Modify parameters of the primitive Java types take Holder classes (e.g.,
<b>IntHolder</b>,
<b>DoubleHolder</b>,
<b>LongHolder</b>,
etc.) in which the values are written, instead of pointers to these types.</li>

<li>
Parameters of other types that are read and read/modify parameters in the
FLI still take structures (e.g., <b>jpl.fli.term_t</b>) as arguments in
the Low-Level interface.&nbsp; This preserves the signature of these methods
as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; A notable exception is the FLI <font face="Courier New,Courier">strip_module</font>
function, which takes a <font face="Courier New,Courier">module_t *</font>
as a parameter; in the Low-Level interface, the <b>strip_module</b> method
takes a <b>module_t</b>, not a Holder for this type.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Using the Low-Level Interface"></a>Using the Low-Level Interface</h3>
Programmers already comfortable with the FLI should find no surprises.&nbsp;
For example, to create a <b>term_t</b> in Java, one would do the same as
one would do in C:
<blockquote>
<pre>term_t t = Prolog.new_term_ref();</pre>
</blockquote>
The difference is that the Java method is now a static native method of
the Prolog class, so the syntax is slightly different than the corresponding
call in C.&nbsp; Moreover, many of the same rules in the FLI apply to the
Low-Level interface, as well.&nbsp; To make a term reference which contains
an atom, for example, one must first create the <b>term_t</b>, then an
<b>atom_t</b>,
and then put the atom into the term, as in the FLI:
<blockquote>
<pre>term_t term = Prolog.new_term_ref();
atom_t atom = Prolog.new_atom( "foo" );
Prolog.put_atom( term, atom );</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Caveats"></a>Caveats</h3>
There is nothing special about the Low-Level interface; it is really just
a straight Java mapping of the FLI, and C programmers familiar with the
FLI should have little difficulty using it.&nbsp; On the other hand, translating
the FLI to Java raises some peculiarities that should be mentioned.
<h4>
<a NAME="Sequential Term References"></a>Sequential Term References</h4>
In the FLI, one can create sequential term references via the <font face="Courier New,Courier">new_term_refs</font>
function:
<blockquote>
<pre>term_t t0 = Prolog.new_term_refs( n);</pre>
</blockquote>
Subsequent references are obtained by <b>t0+1</b>, <b>t0+2</b>, etc.&nbsp;
However, Java does not support operator overloading, so we can't obtain
subsequent term references by offsetting an initial reference.&nbsp; We
can, however, obtain the value field of a <b>term_t</b> structure an compute
subsequent references off that value, as in, for example, <b>t0.value+1</b>,
<b>t0.value+2</b>,
etc.
<h4>
<a NAME="Variable-length Argument Lists"></a>Variable-length Argument Lists</h4>
Some of the C functions in the FLI (e.g, <b>PL_cons_functor()</b>) take
variable-length arguments, function definitions whose argument lengths
are not known at compile time.&nbsp; However, Java has no support for such
definitions; all method definitions must have determinable signatures at
compile time.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>JPL 1.0.1 was designed and implemented before Java acquired <i>anonymous
array</i> syntax (in Java 1.1), which make it feasible to redefine a method
to take an array of arguments in place of a variable-length argument list.&nbsp;
Since the SWI-Prolog FLI provides alternative functions that are equivalent
to these variable-length argument functions, <i>JPL 1.0.1</i> implemented
these.&nbsp; The High-Level interface exploits anonymous array syntax (e.g.
when constructing a <b>Compound</b>), but it has not been considered necessary
to revise the implementation of the Low-Level interface.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="currently unsupported fli functions"></a>Currently unsupported
FLI functions</h4>
A number of SWI-Prolog FLI functions are currently unsupported, and not
needed by the High-Level interface, but could and might be supported in
future versions (preference is likely to be given to those which can sensibly
be made available to applications via the High-Level interface, or which
are necessary to support future extensions to the High-Level interface).
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<a NAME="unsupportable fli functions"></a>Unsupportable FLI functions</h4>
Some SWI-Prolog FLI functions seem inherently unsupportable within this
interface:
<dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>PL_signal()</b></dt>

<dd>
Java can't feasibly register a C function as s signal handler<br>
<BR></dd>

<dt>
<b>PL_action()</b></dt>

<dd>
problems with the argument types and qty; some of these actions may be
useful...<br>
<BR></dd>

<dt>
<b>PL_query()</b></dt>

<dd>
the ARGC, ARGV, MAX_INTEGER, MIN_INTEGER options are redundant</dd>

<dd>
QUERY_VERSION might be useful...</dd>

<dd>
SYMBOLFILE ?<br>
<BR></dd>

<dt>
<b>PL_dispatch_hook()<br>
PL_abort_hook()<br>
PL_abort_unhook()<br>
PL_on_halt()<br>
PL_agc_hook()</b></dt>

<dd>
these are of little value within Java (unless we can install Java methods?!)</dd>
