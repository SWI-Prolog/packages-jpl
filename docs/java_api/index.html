<ul>
   <li> JPL 2.0.2 re-released.</li>

  <ul>
     <li>see <a href="release_notes_202.html">Release Notes</a></li>

  </ul>

 May 5, 1999
<ul>
  <li> JPL 1.0.1 released.&nbsp; This release contains the following changes:</li>

  <ul>
  <li> Fixed a bug with the representation of Tuples.&nbsp; They are now
      <i>always</i>  binary terms, though generally structured as binary
trees.&nbsp; The interface  is the same, except we now require that Tuples
contain <i>at least</i> two elements.&nbsp; (The single element constructor
has been removed, but I consider this a patch, not an interface change)</li>
   <li> Added an ith() accessor to the Compound and Query classes. This is
used to obtain the ith element in the array of Terms in the Compound or Query.</li>
   <li> Added a debugString() method to the Term and Query classes.&nbsp;
This is used to obtain more detailed information about the structure of the
 Term or Query.</li>
   <li> Updated and fixed some of the documentation.</li>
  </ul>

</ul>
  See the <a href="#Copyright%20and%20License%20Information">Copyright and
License Information</a> section for more information.

<ul>
  <li> JPL 1.0.0 is out.&nbsp; Check the <a href="#Download">download</a>
section for information about how to retrieve it.&nbsp; I <i>hope</i> most
of the core interfaces are frozen.</li>
   <li> I am in need of Solaris testers!&nbsp; I have access to a Solaris
box, but it has ancient and outdated compilers, libs, etc.&nbsp; If anyone
gets this to compile on any platform other than Linux, please send me patches.</li>
   <li> Eventually I'd like to work out some config scripts.&nbsp; For now
you must config manually.&nbsp; Sorry.</li>
   <li> I have not even tried getting this to run under Windows.&nbsp; Anyone
with more expertise (and patience) than I is welcome to give it a go!</li>

</ul>

<h3> <a name="General Description"></a>General Description</h3>
  JPL is a set of Java classes and C functions providing an interface between
 Java and Prolog.&nbsp; JPL uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to connect
 to a Prolog engine through the Prolog Foreign Language Interface (FLI),
which is more or less in the process of being standardized in various implementations
 of Prolog.&nbsp; JPL is not a pure Java implementation of Prolog; it makes
 extensive use of native implementations of Prolog on supported platforms.&nbsp;
 The current version of JPL only works with SWI-Prolog.
<p>Currently, JPL only supports the embedding of a Prolog engine within the
Java VM.&nbsp; Future versions may support the embedding of a Java VM within
Prolog, so that, for example, one could take advantage of the rich class structure
of the Java environment from within Prolog. </p>

<p>JPL is designed in two layers, a low-level interface to the Prolog FLI
 and a high-level Java interface for the Java programmer who is not concerned
 with the details of the Prolog FLI.&nbsp; The low-level interface is provided
 for C programmers who may wish to port their C implementations which use
the FLI to Java with minimal fuss. </p>

<h3> <a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h3>
  JPL now requires SWI-Prolog version 3.1.0 or later, which is available
at the following URL:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">http://www.swi-prolog.org/</a></blockquote>
  SWI-Prolog license information is available here:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/license.html">http://www.swi-prolog.org/license.html</a></blockquote>
  You will also need a Java development environment.&nbsp; Sun's Java website
is a good place to start:
<blockquote><a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a></blockquote>
JPL 2.0.2 was developed and tested on Windows NT4, and has not yet been compiled
on any non-Windows platform<br>
JPL1.0.1 was written and tested on Linux kernel 2.1.24.&nbsp; It should compile
 on any other UNIX system with a full suite of gnu tools.
